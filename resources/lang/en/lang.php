 I go to school five days a week except Saturday and Sunday when I have deserved rest.
 Classes in our school start at 8 :30 o'clock in the morning and last till 15:00. Usually we have 6 or 7 lessons a day.
We study a lot of different subjects: Russian, English, History, Geography, Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Math, etc.
I like English most of all. I usually receive good marks in these subjects.
My teachers and parents think that I feel an inclination to these subjects.
A school year is divided into four terms. It begins on the 1st of September known as the Day of knowledge and finishes in May.
Each term is followed by holidays that last one week in autumn and spring and two weeks in winter."];
